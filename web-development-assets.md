# Assets

You will need to host static files such as images, CSS, etc. You dan do so in the 'Assets' section of your web version. In this section of the control panel you can configure assets metadata as well. For example you can set a `maxAge` parameter to configure the way browsers are going to cache the asset.

There is also a builtin filter called `lastModified` that is also very useful for caching assets as well.
